Eclipse SUMO - Simulation of Urban MObility 
===========================================

What is SUMO
------------

["Simulation of Urban MObility" (SUMO)](https://sumo.dlr.de/) is an open source,
highly portable, microscopic traffic simulation package designed to handle
large road networks and different modes of transport.

It is mainly developed by employees of the [Institute of Transportation Systems
at the German Aerospace Center](https://www.dlr.de/ts).


Where to get it
---------------

You can download SUMO from SourceForge via our [downloads site](https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Downloads).

As the program is still under development and is extended continuously, we advice you to
use the latest sources from our GitHub repository. Using a command line client
the following command should work:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/eclipse/sumo


Contact
-------

To stay informed, we have a mailing list for SUMO. You can subscribe at
https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/sumo-user.
Messages to the list can be sent to sumo-user@eclipse.org.
SUMO announcements will be made through the sumo-announce@eclipse.org list;
you can subscribe to this list at https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/sumo-announce.
For further contact information have a look at https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Contact.


Build and Installation
----------------------

For Windows we provide pre-compiled binaries and CMake files to generate Visual Studio projects.
If you want to develop under Windows, please also clone the dependent libraries using

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/DLR-TS/SUMOLibraries

Using Linux you should have a look whether your distribution already contains sumo.
There is also a [ppa for ubuntu users](https://launchpad.net/~sumo) and a
[open build service instance](https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Abehrisch).
If you want to build yourself, the steps for ubuntu are:

        sudo apt-get install cmake python libxerces-c-dev libfox-1.6-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev
        mkdir build/cmake-build && cd build/cmake-build
        cmake ../..
        make -j8

For [detailed build instructions have a look at our wiki](https://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Developer/Main#Build_instructions).


Getting started
---------------

To get started with SUMO, take a look at the docs/tutorial and examples directories,
which contain some example networks with routing data and configuration files.
There is also user documentation provided in the docs/ directory and on the
homepage.


Bugs
----

Please use for bugs and requests the [GitHub bug tracking tool](https://github.com/eclipse/sumo/issues)
or file them to the list sumo-user@eclipse.org. Before
