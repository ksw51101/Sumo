.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-taujf\fR TIME
Factor for calculating the jam\-free
headway time
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-taujj\fR TIME
Factor for calculating the jam\-jam
headway time
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-jam\-threshold\fR FLOAT
Minimum percentage of occupied space to
consider a segment jammed. A negative
argument causes thresholds to be
computed based on edge speed and tauff
(default)
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-multi\-queue\fR
Enable multiple queues at edge ends
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-junction\-control\fR
Enable mesoscopic traffic light and
priority junction handling
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-junction\-control\fR.limited
Enable mesoscopic traffic light and
priority junction handling for
saturated links. This prevents faulty
traffic lights from hindering flow in
low\-traffic situations
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-tls\-penalty\fR FLOAT
Apply scaled time penalties when driving
across tls controlled junctions based
on green split instead of checking
actual phases
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-minor\-penalty\fR TIME
Apply fixed time penalty when driving
across a minor link. When using
\fB\-\-meso\-junction\-control\fR.limited, the
penalty is not applied whenever limited
control is active.
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-overtaking\fR
Enable mesoscopic overtaking
.TP
\fB\-\-meso\-recheck\fR TIME
Time interval for rechecking insertion
into the next segment after failure
.SS "Random Number Options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-random\fR
Initialises the random number generator
with the current system time
.TP
\fB\-\-seed\fR INT
Initialises the random number generator
with the given value
.TP
\fB\-\-thread\-rngs\fR INT
Number of pre\-allocated random number
generators to ensure repeatable
multi\-threaded simulations (should be
at least the number of threads for
repeatable simulations).
.SS "GUI Only Options:"
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gui\-settings\-file\fR FILE
Load visualisation settings from FILE
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quit\-on\-end\fR
Quits the GUI when the simulation stops
.TP
\fB\-G\fR, \fB\-\-game\fR
Start the GUI in gaming mode
.TP
\fB\-\-game\fR.mode STR
Select the game type ('tls', 'drt')
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-start\fR
Start the simulation after loading
.TP
\fB\-\-breakpoints\fR STR
Use TIME[] as times when the simulation
should halt
.TP
\fB\-\-edgedata\-files\fR FILE
Load edge/lane weights for visualization
from FILE
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-demo\fR
Restart the simulation after ending
(demo mode)
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-disable\-textures\fR
Do not load background pictures
.TP
\fB\-\-registry\-viewport\fR
Load current viewport from registry
.TP
\fB\-\-window\-size\fR STR
Create initial window with the given x,y
size
.TP
\fB\-\-window\-pos\fR STR
Create initial window at the given x,y
position
.TP
\fB\-\-tracker\-interval\fR FLOAT
The aggregation period for value tracker
windows
.TP
\fB\-\-gui\-testing\fR
Enable ovelay for screen recognition
.TP
\fB\-\-gui\-testing\-debug\fR
Enable output messages during
GUI\-Testing
